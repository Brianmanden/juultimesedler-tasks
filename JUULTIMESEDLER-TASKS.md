# List of tasks for the Project: Juul Timesedler

## Refactor

* For more flexibility all workers should be able to access and send in their timesheets on all current projects
* Is class ApplicationStartingNotificationHandler necessary ?
* Refactor FE, separation of concerns - move code into classes and services

## TODOs and Errors

* Ask Rasmus about settings for case sensitivity in DTOs / NewtonSoft

## Frontend tasks

* Populate all weekdays (not only Monday) with GUI functionality
  * **WIP** Start out using hardcoded values
  * Refactor models so each weekday has itÂ´s own set of variables
    * Maybe use arrays to hold these
* Fetch timesheets from BE and present them to user in FE app
* Add calendar so workers can browse back in time to see submitted timesheets (and download PDF documents of the given week)
  * From calendar populate tabs with weekdays with dates
    * EG. Monday 14th, Tuesday 15th etc.
* Add extra button for downloading PDF for given week to UI. This button can only be pressed when the given week has been submitted to backend

## Backend tasks

* Build API that serves ~~all~~ the timesheet for a given worker for a given week
* Build API and BE service that can provide a PDF for download of the week the worker has browsed to in the calendar

## Umbraco
